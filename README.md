# Power-BI-Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
This project showcases an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard designed to analyse pizza sales data across various dimensions, including revenue, orders, category, size, and time trends.
This dashboard is the result of applying all my skills and knowledge in Power BI, Excel, and data visualisation to analyse pizza sales performance. It showcases my ability to turn raw data into meaningful, visually appealing insights that support business decision-making.

## 💡 Problem Statement

A pizza chain wants to:
- Track and monitor its sales performance
- Understand which pizzas sell the most
- Analyze buying patterns based on time (days/months)
- Evaluate the impact of pizza **category** and **size** on sales and revenue

As a solution, I designed this Power BI dashboard to fulfil all those needs.

## 📈 Key Business Questions Answered

1. What is the total revenue, total pizzas sold, and total number of orders?
2. What’s the busiest time of the week/month for orders?
3. Which pizza category and size generate the highest sales?
4. Who are the top 5 and bottom 5 performing pizza products?
5. What is the average order value and average pizzas per order?
6. How does revenue trend over months?

## 📌 Objective

To create a dynamic dashboard that enables business users to:

- Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue, orders, and AOV.
- Identify best and worst performing pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders.
- Discover customer behavior trends across days, months, and pizza types.
- Support data-driven decision-making using visual storytelling.
